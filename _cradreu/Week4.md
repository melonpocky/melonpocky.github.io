This has been a challenging week so far! So my colleagues and I were trying to understand how the database was set up. 
SQL is a fickle beast. 
Also, we came across dialogue about how the server is under AWS free trial which can pose an issue as there is a chance to be overbilled for it.

I have heard stories of students being overbilled for using AWS, and you aren't able to use a virtual credit card that is tied to your actual credit card, 
so if you get charged and exorbitant amount, you might have a financial heart attack.
