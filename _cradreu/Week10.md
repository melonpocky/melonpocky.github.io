We discovered a few database issues during this time and realized that a lot of 
the data provided is disorganized. For example, what can you categorize the Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering as?
Would that school just be part of Computer Science? Electrical Engineering? Or both? Our data needs to reflect that change. Also, professors come and go from different schools, how can we integrate new professors coming into these schools to the database?
Anyways, a lot of things in the database need to be explored and refined further to create accurate results. Overall, this has been an interesting and insightful journey 
to what research entails, and I for one, like it! I hope that I am able to meet wonderful people once I get into higher academia who collaborate and support one another.

With that, I will be presenting my research at Grace Hopper Celebration and Tapia. I want to take the time to place my poster presentation here because I do not think I am able to present it elsewhere as both conferences have their own presentation styles and templates.
