* A brief description of your project:
* How many weeks have you worked so far, and how many weeks do you have left?
* What is the status of your project? (include what you have accomplished so  far and what you expect to accomplish in the rest of the summer)
* What has been your biggest challenge so far? What is the most exciting thing that has happened so far?
* What is your working environment? For example, how frequently do you meet  your mentor, the grad students in your group, others in the department,  etc? Are you working on your project alone, with another undergrad, or  with a graduate student. Have you attended any research talks?
* What is your housing and roommate situation?
* Is there anything else that you would like us to know about your  experience? Is there anything you would like to tell your mentor (these  comments, if any, will be forwarded to your mentor)?
