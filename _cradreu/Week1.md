During this week I got started on the onboarding process and I got to meet with the rest of the research team under Cal Poly SLO's Mapping and Visualization (of) Academic Collaborations(MAVAC) Project. 
From there, I was trained by fellow colleagues on setting up my python environment and learning how to use the following technologies: Python Pandas and NetworkX packages.
I also learned SQL basics during this onboarding process through CodeAcademy.
