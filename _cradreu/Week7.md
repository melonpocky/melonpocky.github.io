Continuing on with adding another university, CSULB, to the Scopus Database. I've been assigned to 
scrape different departments such as as electrical engineering and math. 
Web scrapping has made me cognizant of the inconsistencies between department webpages.
I thought there would be some standardized format through university webpages, but I guess not. 
It's even in the url too! Makes me think about potential vulnerabilities and concerns in my honest opinion.
