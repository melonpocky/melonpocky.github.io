I was assigned a web-scraping task where I would scrap professor's names and emails using the Beautiful Soup package in Python. After scraping the data, I would put it in a csv file to be uploaded into the scopus database. 
Interestingly enough, I had to ask we would need to consider edge cases such as if the collaborator does not have their email. The emails of these professors help with accuracy.
