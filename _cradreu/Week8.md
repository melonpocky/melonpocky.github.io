I like alliterations. I've been working with another student to work on uploading our web-scrapped data to the SQL database and we've come across an impasse.
I feel like this is another lesson of writing good documentation. Hm maybe I should push that to the git repo. Would that come off as passive aggressive? 
I don't know, but I am surely suffering the consequences of it!

There was code that was referenced to add our scrapped data to the database, but in actuality, it was a means to check between the web scrapped data to pre-existing data that was already in the database.
Welp lesson learned, no wonder the individuals on the backend (like me) were very confused. 

So with that issue at hand, we discussed this matter to our PI and decided to see what we can do to organize the database before adding anything else.
