The student’s final report is a technical paper describing his/her research project. It should be included in the student’s final website.

- The paper should provide a technical description of the project and  the results you obtained. It should include a scholarly review of the  related prior work, including citations to the relevant literature. The  writing style and technical level should be similar to that which would  be used for a paper published in a technical conference in that research area.
- A presentation (e.g., powerpoint slides) is **not acceptable** as your final report – you must provide a technical paper. However, you are welcome to include a technical presentation *in addition* to your paper. Indeed, this is strongly encouraged if you have prepared a presentation on your project.
- All materials (the required paper, and the optional presentation) should be provided in **pdf** or **postscript** format. You can do this easily by using a postscript printer and  printing to a file or by using a freely available program such as pdf995 to “print” documents to a pdf file.
