I am so glad that I am in a program called Data Science 4 All (DS4A) while being part of this program. 
A lot of the research that I am doing for MAVAC has ties with data science.
With that, there was an extended case from DS4A which was about SQL. 
I am beginning to understand how to use SQL even further after finishing the extended case. 
So, a brief introduction about the program, from the [site](https://www.correlation-one.com/students): 
* *Get the best data science training in the world, be part of a diverse professional community, and get hired. 'Data Science for All' is merit-based and free for those who identify as Black, LatinX, Women and LGTQ+.*

I like the program overall! I would say that it is A LOT of content within 2 weeks then 2 weeks of break in a span of 9 months or so. 
I feel that if you want to thrive in the program, having a computer science background will truly help you succeed in this course.
