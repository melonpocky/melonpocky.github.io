As part of the final milestone and to develop a paper for conferences, I have been delving into the technical paper writing process. 
What does that mean? For me, that means a lot of googling and a lot of reading! I've discussed with my mentor on what I should do to develop a technical paper; however, 
I feel that I am heavily relying on the content from the other technical papers created for this lab. 

I am left with questions such as, is it alright to quote from previous papers but with proper citation? 
Where should I put my name in the paper? Supposedly, the first person whose name is listed is considered the individual who contributed the most and descends from there. 
I do not know where to place myself in this technical paper. 

As of now, my main role on the project is creating an accurate construction of the network through web-scrapping, 
but I feel that my role could be explained within two sentences or so. Although it is important, maybe I have not had a grasp *how* important it is. 
I like doing web scrapping work, as it has a lot of practical applications. I could use what I've learned to automate for job listings that interest me without spending so much time in the vetting process. 
Scholarships, grants galore! Actually, wait that is a good idea, I should start making a scrapper for those two topics. 

But with that, I've been learning and studying the process of writing technical papers, and I have been talking to friends and mentors who went through the process as well. 
I learned today that a technical paper can become a publication if it is accepted to a conference. Most likely I am still green in the research process, and I hope to learn more about it as a whole as I delve into my research career.
