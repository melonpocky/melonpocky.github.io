<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>
This summer, I was mentored by 
<a href="https://theresamigler.com/">Theresa Migler</a> and <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~zwood/">Zoë Wood</a> at Cal Poly SLO under the Mapping and Visualization of Academic Collaborations Project ( or MAVAC for short). 

MAVAC is an ongoing project that aims to discover key insights towards academic equity. For this project, our collaboration network consists of nodes representing researchers and edges representing the collaboration between authors of a shared publication.

My role in the project was under data and design where I would webscrap data to create an accurate construction of the network and contributed to database redesign. 

The website is still in development so please bear with me.
