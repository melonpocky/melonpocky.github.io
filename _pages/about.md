Hello! Welcome to my site! 

I am a junior majoring in Computer Science, focusing on Cybersecurity at California State University Northridge.

I hope to graduate in the spring of 2023 with my BS in Computer Science. When I am finished with my Bachelor's, I hope that I am able to pursue a PhD within the realm of Cybersecurity as we face many threats within our digital landscape today. 

I do a lot of things, this blargh is merely a portfolio of my work in computer science.

The website is still in development so please bear with me.
