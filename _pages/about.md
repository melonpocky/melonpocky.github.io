Hello! Welcome to my site! 

I am a sophomore student majoring in Computer Science, focusing on Cybersecurity at El Camino College.

I will be transferring to California State University Northridge during fall 2021 for Computer Science. I hope that I am able to pursue a PhD within the realm of Cybersecurity as we face many threats within our digital landscape today. 

During Summer of 2021, I will be mentored by [Theresa Migler](https://theresamigler.com/) at Cal Poly SLO to research the network collaboration within Cal Poly SLO faculty. 

If you would like to learn more about my research during Summer, please refer [here](https://melonpocky.github.io/cradreu/).  

The website is still in development so please bear with me.
